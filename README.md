This repository is my own source code for personal algorithm exercise, which had accepted by the Online Judge(OJ). I will update this repository continually and randomly.

I sort codes by OJ, separeted by folders.

## Course & Guideline

Rujia Liu's books are my main guideline. I'm following his courses to do some exercises on UVaOJ.

## Contest

I would participate in CodeForces or BestCoder contest randomly.

**The codes on BestCoder will be sorted to HDU folder.**

**The ones on ICPC Live Archive will be sorted to UVa folder.**

## Online Judge

- [BestCoder](http://bestcoder.hdu.edu.cn/rating.php?user=MFunction)
- [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/MFunction)
- [HDU](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/userstatus.php?user=MFunction)
- [UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/)
- [ICPC Live Archive](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php)
- [Virtual Judge](https://vjudge.net/user/MFunction)

## Accepted List

This section will list the Accepted question IDs, separeted by OJ, sorted by Accepted time.

The question ID which the question is solved by more efficient solution than guideline, whether optimized for space complexity(S) or time complexity(T), or both(ST), will mark "(S)", "(T)" or "(ST)" following the ID.

For example, **340(ST).**
