This repository is my own source code for personal algorithm exercise, which had accepted by the Online Judge(OJ). I will update this repository continually and randomly.

I sort codes by OJ, separeted by folders.

## Course & Guideline

Rujia Liu's books are my main guideline. I'm following his courses to do some exercises on UVaOJ.

## Contest

I would participate in CodeForces or BestCoder contest randomly.

**The codes on BestCoder will be sorted to HDU folder.**

**The ones on ICPC Live Archive will be sorted to UVa folder.**
